<p> Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, universities around the
    country have cancelled admitted students days and campus tours.
    These programs and tours allow universities one last chance to
    sell their campus to prospective students. </p>

<p> According to The New York Times,

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/well/family/coronavirus-college-visits-high-school-students.html" target="_blank">schools like the University of Washington</a>

    are offering information sessions via Zoom for
    prospective students and their families. Paul Seegert, the director
    of undergraduate admissions, said they are hoping to have campus tour
    guides speak with prospective students on Zoom.</p>

<p> Some universities have decided to extend their deadline to accept
    admission, which is typically May 1. Andy Borst, the director of
    undergraduate admissions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
    said many universities are

    to June 1.</p>

<p>In the city of College Park, Md,

<p> Mt. Lebanon High School senior, Carter Gannon, is in the midst of making his
    college decision. His top two choices at the moment are Case Western Reserve
    University in Cleveland, Ohio, and Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, Va. </p>

<p>“They are extremely different primarily due to their student
    populations and locations. I thought one last tour at Virginia
    Tech would cause me to lean more toward one or the other,” Gannon said.</p>

<p>Gannon said it will be more difficult to make a decision now that he
   cannot visit campuses in person. He will be taking advantage of virtual
   tours in order to make his decision as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“Trying to decide what school I want to attend is a big decision,
    and that is probably why I want to continue to push my decision back,”
    Gannon said. “ However, my parents really wanted me to decide by the end of March.”</p>

<p> High school seniors are not the only people upset about tours
    and admitted student day cancellations. Campus tour guides around
    the country are disappointed because they are not able to participate
    in a hobby or have lost an income.</p>

<p> Maryland Images is the official campus tour guide organization at
    the University of Maryland. The tour guides at the university are not
    paid, but many of them look forward to the spring when they have the
    opportunity to share their love of UMD with admitted students.

    in order to highlight the important parts of campus.</p>

<p> Tour guides are expected to hit a minimum of six tours for the Spring 2020
    semester, according to Group Tours Coordinator Michael Keffler.  A typical
    semester for a tour guide consists of 10 tours, two recruitment activities
    and two social activities. Over 52 tours were canceled in just the month
    of March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p> As a tour guide, Riley does not believe virtual tours are the
    best solution for prospective students.</p>

<p> “I think virtual tours certainly should be an option, but I
    don’t necessarily think it’s an adequate alternative just
    because there’s nothing like being there in person,” Riley said.
    “I think a good alternative would be the option for prospective seniors
    to be able to get matched with a current student and be able to talk
    or text about any questions and concerns they may have so they can still
    get their burning questions answered by a real student.”</p>

<p>While Riley was upset to leave campus and have tours cancelled,
   she sympathized more for prospective students who may be struggling
   to make a decision and senior campus tour guides who never got to
   give their last tour.</p>

<p>“I mean honestly I was sad. Of course I was sad for myself,
    but mostly I was so sad for all the [high school] seniors who
    wanted to come visit UMD to make their decision. There’s nothing
    better than going to visit a campus in person, and I feel like that
    experience has been taken away from current seniors,” Riley said.
    “I also felt awful for college seniors who were tour guides who never
    got to prepare for what would be their last tour.”</p>

<p>Sophomore journalism major Molly Cuddy is a tour guide at UMD.
   She only gave four tours this semester before being forced to leave campus.</p>

<p>“When we went online I obviously knew there wasn’t going to be
    any more tours, so I was upset just because I feel like I didn’t
    get to give as many as I wanted to,” Cuddy said. “I enjoy doing
    it and I feel like I didn’t get to get the full experience of
    being a rookie and giving my first semester of tours.”</p>

<p>Having tours cancelled for over half a semester did
  not allow Cuddy to meet her tour requirement. She will not be
  penalized, but she was looking forward to showing prospective
  students why she loves UMD. She said due to COVID-19, she will have
  a different mindset when giving tours in the future.</p>

<p>“I’m definitely going to get a different perspective when I
    start giving tours again next semester because I’ll think about
    all the people who weren’t able to take tours that wanted to,”
    Cuddy said. “Now I understand more than ever than people rely
    so much on college tours and I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
